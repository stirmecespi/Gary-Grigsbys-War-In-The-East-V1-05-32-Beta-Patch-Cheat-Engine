- The number of men, vehicles, freight, fuel, ammo, and supplies of any unit or depot.
- The experience, morale, readiness, and efficiency of any unit or leader.
- The weather, terrain, rail capacity, and air density of any hex.
- The production, research, reinforcement, and replacement pools of any nation.
- The victory points, prestige points, political points, and war readiness of any nation.
